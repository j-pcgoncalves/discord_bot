# Discord Bot

This is a simple Discord Bot built with NodeJs. It integrates with discord.js to implement all the bot functionality.

## How to Use

If you wish to run this project on your own computer you can clone it. After that you just need to create a file called .env in the root folder and add the next keys:

- DISCORD_TOKEN: "Your own Discord Token"
- CLIENT_ID: "Your own Discord Client ID"
- GUILD_ID: "Your own Discord Guild ID"
- WEATHER_API_KEY: "Your own weatherapi.com API Key"

Done with that, you can write in your terminal "npm install" to install all the dependencies and then "npm run dev" to start the bot.
